# Modelling

Here I will briefly go over each of my models I made for the course work

## Woodaxe
The first model I made was this axe, In my first atempt I tried to model it as one big
object by starting with a cube, extruding and handle from it and so on. However I was
not happy with it and it was difficult to work with so I scrapped it and tried again.

On my secound attempt I split the axe into two pieces, I first modeled a axe head by 
extruding and scaling up secetions of a cube while trying to match the refrence image
which is in the axe folder. This was much easier then the other way I had tried, I 
used bridge edge loops to make a hole to fit my handle.

To make a handle I first my a cylinder and squshed it a bit till I got the basic shape
I wanted. I then added alot of loop cuts to the handle and scaled and moved each loop
to match the background image.

Finally I added a Subdivision Surface modifier to each onject to smooth them a bit,
and where necessary adding loop cuts and indents to maintain the shape I wanted.

Lastly there was the textures, first I did the handle, I used a wood texture and lowered
the roughness to give it a nice sheen. I found a nice rough texture I liked which I used
for the base of my metalic textures.
