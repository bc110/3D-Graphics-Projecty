# Interaction
## Imports
I have imported all models from blender. However there where significant issues with my meshes to the point that I was unable to further test and develop the other requirements I spent many days trying to fix it but unfortuntly I was unable to fix or even understand why my meshes broke to such a horific degree.

## Scene design
Due to the afformentuned issues I was left in a situation where there was very little I could do with my scene design as the meshes did not have many options. As such I decided on a scene design as such that an object would slowly rotate such that the user could view the object. They could then press a key from 1 to 7 to swap to another model. Here a basic animation would play where the object would shrink down till its scale was 0, from which the object would switch and that would scale up to its standard size.

## Lighting
I went for a relativly basic point light for my application as out of the severla I tested I belived it looked the best. Due to the model issues however it was impossible to test and expand much apon it, such as reflictive materials and such.

## FPS camera
My scene made use of an FPS camera that corrisponded to the "WASD" keys. Like a FPS game you can move in 3D space to look around your envioments. Usinf your mouse moves your camera like you might suspect and moving forward moves you based on the direction the camera is facing.

## Reflection
Overall I am quite disaponted in what I have to show due to the inability to render my imported models and how this cascaded in to lowing the standerd of the rest of the project. In terms of interaction I feel I acived a good level of interaction with well implemted movement and a meaningful ability to interact with the scene though the ability to change models shown to the user though a simple but effective animation. The lighting is simple but very functional as shadows are correctly cast on object and other sides are lit up. However the scope is limited due to the being unable to test better lighting on my functional models. And finally my model imports was an abject falure and I do not know why such a falure happened, I tried many diffrent ideas to solve the issue which ultimatly culminated to nothing and as such I have nothing to show for days of hard work which is dissapointing.

The clear improvment in my project is to redo my importing of my models such that they are rendered correctly with working meshes. From this I could experment more with the lighting. However im pleased with my interactabillity. Finaly I needed to better manage my times, due to 4 pices of coursework being due at the same time I left to little time to complete this project, this was further damaged by unexpected issues taking up more time then I had anticipated. In future I should check well ahead of deadlines if I am able to implement systems in a timely manor and give myself more time to ask for help when I need it.
