## Import Issues
I suffered a few import issues with blender to unreal 5 here are a few

# Textures
None of my textures copied over correctly so I had to redo all my textures which was time consuming
and also why the objects look so diffrent in unreal 5.

# Faces wroung way around
Another issue I had was on one of my models had some faces that where the wroung way around causing
pretty bad visula issues. Lukly it was easily solved in blender by recalculating the front faces
but took a while to find the issue.

# My sign had many issues
The wood sign had alot of visual issues and was cery difficult to fix. I never found the issue but 
instead exported it as a object in blender re imported the exported it again to unreal 5 and that 
solved the issue. For some reason...



## Animation
For this project all of the animation in my vidio was done by using the sequancer
I added many objects as actors to the sequancer I then moved them and created movement 
by moving the object then adding it to the key frame. I then eddited the graph and added 
more key frames till I was happy with the animation.
